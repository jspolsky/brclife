# Black Rock City Life - Event Visualizer

Last night I was thinking about how placement tries to place camps with the goal of creating balanced neighborhoods where there's always something going on. I do remember as I hiked around black rock city having a sense that certain neighborhoods and time periods were much more active than others. Sometimes my whole block was fully dead; other times I walked down certain blocks and it seemed like every camp was fully lit up with activity.

I realized that with the data in the API it should be super easy just to make a visualizer that shows all scheduled events on a map with a slider that lets you set the time and see the events happening at that time, lit up. So I made one!
